      AI is treated as a useful but unreliable tool.
      It is used deliberately, verified systematically,
      and never treated as an authority.

    theme: Portfolio progress and evaluation of AI in real development workflows

    placement: after_tldr
    wording: canonical_frozen

  intent:
    primary:
      - Document early portfolio development progress
      - Establish a realistic baseline for evaluating AI assistance
    secondary:
      - Demonstrate informed and disciplined AI usage
      - Set expectations for slower but more inspectable progress

  content:
    focus:
      - Rebuilding scaled-down versions of older enterprise projects
      - Using prior work as a stable baseline for comparison
      - Emphasizing understanding and correctness over speed

          Initial reconstruction of an older internal tool previously built
          under enterprise constraints.
      completed:
        - Project scaffolding recreated
        - Core structure mapped against original design
      open_questions:
        - Which parts benefit meaningfully from AI assistance
        - Where manual reconstruction is still required

    ai_usage_observations:
      helpful_for:
        - Scaffolding and boilerplate generation
        - Recalling framework idioms not used recently
        - Acting as a second set of eyes during refactoring
      not_helpful_for:
        - Architectural decisions
        - Correctness guarantees
        - Recovering original design intent

    constraints_and_tradeoffs:
      - Reconstruction chosen over redesign to preserve comparability
      - Progress intentionally slowed to maintain clarity
      - Novelty deprioritized in favor of signal
