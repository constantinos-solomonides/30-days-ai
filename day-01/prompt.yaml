        motivations:
            - Build better expertise on correctly using AI
            - Build part of my portfolio using AI
            - Showcase work I did in the past for employers by re-implementing a scaled-down version of tools
        rules for the experiment:
            - Use the pareto principle, meaning invest 20% of the effort to let AI take me 80% of the way, then edit
            - The ideas *must* come from me
            - A document like this will be the basis for the work, will be updated
            - I will be using the paid version of OpenAI, as the paid version is default in the corporate world
