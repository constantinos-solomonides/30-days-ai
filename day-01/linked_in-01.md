I’m running a 30-day experiment using AI to write articles and rebuild parts of my portfolio — deliberately, and with skepticism, to evaluate the impact it has on my workflow and showcase my work.

I plan to use AI the way I’d use an enthusiastic junior: it helps me get roughly 80% of the way there, then I review, correct, and take responsibility for the result, in line with the Pareto principle[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle].

The day 1 post focuses on the experiment and explains why I’m rebuilding scaled-down versions of older projects instead of building something entirely new
