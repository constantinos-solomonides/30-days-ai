project: ai_experiment
conversation: "30 day AI experiment - day 04"
phase: "sandbox experimentation → article writing"

objectives:
  - Continue work from Day 03 sandbox environment
  - Integrate multiple AI backends in an isolated Docker-based setup
  - Validate Ollama, OpenAI, and Codex CLI integration
  - Keep infrastructure correct even if services are inactive (no credits)

day_03_actual_goals:
  - Verify that Ollama works reliably for local inference
  - Add an agent container to enable full automation
  - Check whether OpenAI can be integrated into the sandbox

global_rules:
  ris:
    status: closed
    applied:
      - article_writing_ris_latest
      - code_development_ris_latest
  pii_handling:
    rule_active: true
    behavior:
      - immediately report detected PII
      - avoid propagating secrets unless explicitly instructed
    note: user explicitly allowed proceeding despite API key exposure during debugging

sandbox_context:
  base_from_day: 03
  architecture:
    - vim container (primary UI)
    - ollama container (local LLM inference)
    - codex container (OpenAI Codex CLI sidecar)
  constraints:
    - no Docker volumes (bind-mounted directories only)
    - UID/GID inside containers must match host user
    - sandboxed filesystem access
    - sidecar pattern for AI tools

ollama_status:
  issue:
    - initial model load timeout
  resolution:
    - root cause: client-side timeout during cold start
    - verification: all models respond when called directly
  outcome: working and stable

openai_integration:
  api_key:
    configured_via_env: true
    propagation: docker-compose environment variables
  network_debugging:
    curl_root_endpoint: HTTP 421 (ignored)
    curl_v1_authenticated: success
    conclusion: connectivity correct
  billing_status:
    credits: 0
    billing_ui_behavior:
      - hour caps displayed as available
      - no usable credits present
    result:
      - authentication works
      - all generation requests rejected
    decision: no further debugging required

codex_integration:
  cli_version: 0.94.0
  container_status:
    build: correct
    permissions: verified
    workspace_access: verified
    auth_status: logged in using API key
  runtime_behavior:
    launches_successfully: true
    model_default: gpt-5.1-codex-mini
    generation_attempts: blocked
    error: quota exceeded
  conclusion:
    - infrastructure correct
    - blocked solely by API credits
    - no code or config changes required when credits are added later

significant_results:
  - openai_outage:
      description: >
        An OpenAI outage blocked progress during Day 03/04, which was critical
        because the experiment is intentionally AI-first.
      evidence:
        search_link: "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=chatgpt+down&df=2026-02-02..2026-02-03&t=ffab&atb=v264-1&ia=web"
        action_required: find and link relevant outage articles from this search
  - billing_confusion:
      description: >
        The billing interface showed hourly caps as available while actual
        usable credits were zero, leading to misleading signals during debugging.

evaluation:
  agentic_openai_approach:
    outcome: failed
    reason:
      - requires upfront payments
      - introduces risk of runaway costs
  next_direction:
    - prioritize free and open-source models
    - explore open-source agent frameworks
    - attempt the same agentic workflows without paid APIs

decisions_made:
  - Accept Codex container as dormant until credits exist
  - Use Ollama as default inference backend
  - Defer OpenAI-based agentic workflows
  - Pivot toward free / open-source agents
  - Stop Day 04 experimentation once root causes were identified

current_mode:
  status: article_writing
  scope:
    - summarize experimentation outcomes
    - analyze dependency risks of AI-first workflows
    - contrast paid vs free agentic approaches
    - no further sandbox debugging unless explicitly reopened

notes_for_future_articles:
  - Separate infrastructure correctness from service availability
  - Highlight how outages and billing UX can dominate engineering time
  - Emphasize fragility of AI-first workflows with external dependencies
  - Position sandboxing as valuable even when upstream services fail
