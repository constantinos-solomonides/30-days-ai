# Week 1 AI Experiment -- Version A (Original Prompt Logic)

## TL;DR

-   Writing output increased because drafting and structure became
    easier.
-   Coding required repeated correction cycles and convergence was slow.
-   Ethical and infrastructure concerns remain unresolved.

After one week, the tools show mixed results. Writing stabilizes faster
than coding. Broader claims of transformation are not supported by
current experience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

This is a review of my first week using AI tools for writing and coding.
I am focusing on what actually happened during use, not what might
happen in theory. The goal is to describe friction, debugging loops,
cost, and limits.

### Premise

I am treating this as a practical experiment, not a belief exercise. I
am not trying to prove that AI works or that it fails. I am observing
what happens when I integrate it into real workflows.

I am evaluating output, convergence time, and stability. I am separating
hype from daily integration. I will not draw long-term conclusions from
short-term results.

I see AI agents as a leap from search engines. When Google search first
appeared, it changed access to information but did not eliminate the
need for judgment. I am approaching AI in a similar way: useful, but not
self-sufficient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing Experience

Writing output increased quickly. Drafts assemble faster. Structure
appears earlier in the process. It is easier to expand notes into full
sections.

However, repeated iterations reveal tone compression. Language becomes
smoother but less distinct. Sentence rhythm standardizes. The gain is
higher output; the tradeoff is reduced stylistic variation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coding Experience

Coding exposed more instability. Generated code often appears correct
but contains small logical gaps. Fixing one issue can reveal another.
Debugging becomes iterative.

The model performs better with tightly defined tasks. Broader
integration reduces reliability. Context handling weakens across
correction cycles. Convergence can require multiple prompt rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sandbox

The sandbox remains unreliable. Without stable execution isolation,
autonomous workflows cannot operate safely. Many agent-style use cases
assume this layer works consistently. It currently does not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Economic Cost

Iteration increases API usage. Costs accumulate mainly during debugging
loops. Output gains in drafting do not remove engineering convergence
overhead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Broader Concerns

### Environmental Impact

Large-scale systems require substantial energy. This cost remains part
of the equation.

### Knowledge Work Displacement

Pattern-based cognitive tasks appear more exposed than high-context
engineering work.

### Concentration of Power

Infrastructure and model ownership remain centralized. Dependency risk
is structural.

### Acceleration vs Exploitation

Acceleration increases output for structured professionals. It may also
increase pressure on adjacent roles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

After one week, AI tools assist structured drafting but struggle with
stable engineering convergence. Replacement narratives are not supported
by current results. I will continue testing before forming stronger
conclusions.
