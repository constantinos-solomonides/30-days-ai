  intent:
    primary:
      - reflect on the progress, the challenges and the benefits of going full-on AI for the first week
    secondary:
      - Reflect on the need to step back from AI
      - Discuss the need to pay for AI and the moral and political implications

    introduction:
      - Recap:
        - 30 day experiment of maximum use of AI for workflows
        - Using 20/80 rule, the expectation is to get 80% of the way there by investing 20% of effort for prompt
        - Using recreation of past-projects as a way to compare then and now
        - Writing articles from prompts to compare ease of use
        - Using the cheapest for-paid OpenAI tier
        - First step is building a sandbox to safely run AI agents from within
        - Use of ready-made solutions was avoided, as it would mask the AI/manual effort into building the sandbox
        - >
          The process follows the reasoning of "bootstrapping" for compilers
          (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_\(compilers\))
      - A smart tool doesn't force you into choosing between safety and efficiency

    premises:
      - I am not against using any one tool or language
      - The tools must be used by people who can use them safely
      - I find the black-and-white approach by colleagues as misguided as the over-hyping by the industry

        "Amara's law (https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/trends/amaras-law-and-tech-future)", quote
        "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run"
    summary of the week:
      - Writing articles from prompts and refinement went well enough
      - Write LinkedIn posts went well enough
      - Feeding final product back to ChatGPT to identify differences between output and my writing style
      - Asking to provide files and scripts for sandbox
      - End result is no working sandbox yet
      - Had to do a full-manual day because the iterative approach wasn't converging
    overall experience:
      - Paid-for model allows a more uninterrupted flow of work
      - Writing became faster but it has significant downsides
      - Linked-in post shortening works well enough
      - The development process is slow to kickstart
      - Use of remote agents can rack-up costs very fast, local agents are not so efficient due to processing demands
    concerns, caveats and pain-points:
      - writing:
        - Writing has way less identity / is more generic
        - The style is that of an annoying, grandiose speaker, and needs to be toned down manually
        - Even repeated prompts and RSI expansions don't take the salesperson smell away
        - Articles and links hallucinated frequently, even when told explicitly to search and verify elements
        - Writing the prompt as a list helps identifying key points and could help significantly with manual writing too
        - Perhaps difference in speed when doing first-draft-as-bullets with manual writing VS editing not so significant
      - LinkedIn posts:
        - Shortening works mostly OK, starts at a ~70% of the final
        - 70% to 80% takes multiple prompts
      - Coding:
        - Weakest part by far
        - Sycophantic approach is not a good one for developing software
        - There's a reason `git imperative` is used [Git Commit Styleguide](https://github.com/goodbyekansas/git-commit-styleguide)
        - Rubber ducks should be silent or skeptical, saying "yes" is counter-productive
        - It produces complicated solutions, with too much fluff
        - Reading code is harder than writing it, so a risk there
        - Had to revert to manual to identify the issue
        - When acting like an intermediary, it's best to go for the simplest possible approach instead of something big
      - moral and ethical concerns:
        - Environmental concerns
        - Negative impact to the job market
        - AI does not solve the problems yet, but it's a good excuse
        - examples:
          - https://hbr.org/2026/01/companies-are-laying-off-workers-because-of-ais-potential-not-its-performance
          - https://fortune.com/2026/02/10/ai-washing-and-forever-layoffs-why-companies-keep-cutting-jobs-even-amid-rising-profits/
          - https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/19/firms-are-blaming-ai-for-job-cuts-critics-say-its-a-good-excuse.html
        - Using paid-for AI is supporting companies and indirectly political causes that people may disagree with
        - AI has nefarious uses, industry improvements improve all use-cases

    evaluation of overall experience:
      - Waiting for working sandbox to form an opinion
      - Having to do manual work points to experience remaining invaluable
      - A skilled worker with the right power tool can do way more than fully automated tools
      - The hype over the recent post by anthropic https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler glosses over important details
      - issues with article:
        - High cost to converge
        - Still not fully functional output
        - Was run by a high-level expert
        - The problem is very well defined
        - The solution to it was very likely part of the training data used for the agents as it's FOSS
    closing remarks:
      - I do believe AI is here to stay
      - I do plan on incorporating it in my workflow
      - I do believe we're heading towards an industry, very likely financial, possibly social boom
      - I plan on going back to the basics and rebuilding my foundation to look under the hood (maths, algorithms etc. for LLMs)
