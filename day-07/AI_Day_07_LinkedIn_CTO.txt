AI Day 07 — First Week Retrospective (CTO Edition)

I set a benchmark before starting this 30-day experiment:

If 20% of prompt effort produces 80% of the outcome, it’s a success.

After one week, it’s closer to 40/60.

Here’s the operational reality so far:

-   Writing drafts are faster, but require substantial refinement.
-   Code generation is quick, but convergence is slow.
-   Debugging often introduces secondary issues.
-   Bootstrapping a secure sandbox is significantly harder than
    marketed.

The pattern I’m seeing is consistent:

AI accelerates first drafts. It does not accelerate stable integration.

In practice, the bottleneck is cost-to-convergence — not initial output.

Concrete example: In a sandbox bootstrap attempt, generated scripts
failed due to incorrect assumptions about environment variables (UID,
GID) and mount behavior. Fixable — but symptomatic. The system produces
plausible code that requires experienced validation.

This is not an anti-AI stance.

It’s a maturity assessment.

There is real leverage in constrained tasks. There is friction in
system-level reasoning, edge cases, and integration.

The broader question for leadership is not: “Does AI generate code?”

It’s: “Does it reduce total engineering effort once validation,
security, and long-term maintenance are included?”

I also briefly address in the article:

-   AI being cited in restructuring decisions
-   Concentration of infrastructure power
-   Environmental and governance considerations

Not as ideology — but as risk management context.

Expectation velocity is high. Integration maturity is uneven.

That gap matters.
