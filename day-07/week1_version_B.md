# Week 1 AI Experiment -- Version B (Context-Updated Prompt)

## TL;DR

-   Writing output expanded through structural assistance and reduced
    drafting friction.
-   Coding showed high cost-to-convergence and unreliable debugging
    support.
-   Ethical, economic, and infrastructure limits weaken autonomy claims.

Week one shows bounded usefulness rather than transformation. Gains in
drafting contrast with instability in engineering workflows. Claims of
near-term autonomous replacement are not supported by integration
reality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

This is a first-week operational review of using AI in writing and
coding. I am measuring friction, convergence cost, stability, and
integration limits. The focus is direct evidence from repeated use.

### Premise

I am approaching this experiment as an engineer, not as an advocate or
critic. My goal is to measure how these tools behave under practical
constraints. I am tracking output, validation effort, debugging loops,
and convergence stability.

I am not assuming transformation. I am testing claims against
integration reality. If the tools reduce friction, I will note it. If
they introduce instability, I will document that as well.

I see AI agents as a leap from search engines. When Google search first
appeared, it changed how information was accessed, but it did not
replace expertise or judgment. I am evaluating AI in that same light: as
a tool whose usefulness depends on context and constraints.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing Experience

Drafting becomes easier. The model suggests structure and expands ideas
into paragraphs. Output increases because early-stage friction
decreases.

Over time, tone compression appears. Language smooths into predictable
phrasing. Variation narrows. The tool improves fluency but reduces
distinct stylistic edges. The tradeoff becomes visible after several
iterations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coding Experience

Coding reveals cost-to-convergence as the main constraint. Generated
code is often plausible but incomplete. Small logical errors require
correction. Correction loops sometimes introduce additional refinements.

The model struggles with multi-step debugging and integration tasks.
Context drift appears across iterations. Stable convergence requires
active human validation. Engineering judgment remains central to
reliable output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sandbox

The sandbox remains technically unstable. Without reliable execution
boundaries, agent-style workflows cannot be trusted. Infrastructure
maturity, not language fluency, limits autonomy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Economic Cost

Iteration amplifies API usage. Debugging cycles increase cost. Output
gains in drafting do not offset convergence overhead in engineering
tasks. Cost-to-convergence becomes measurable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Broader Concerns

### Environmental Impact

Training and inference require significant energy. Usage reinforces
awareness of cumulative impact.

### Knowledge Work Displacement

Pattern-oriented roles appear more exposed. High-context system design
remains less affected in current observation.

### Concentration of Power

Infrastructure and model development remain centralized. Long-term
dependency risks persist.

### Acceleration vs Exploitation

Acceleration increases output for experienced professionals who can
constrain and validate results. Benefits are unevenly distributed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

After one week, AI tools provide conditional augmentation. They assist
structured tasks but do not replace judgment. Integration friction
limits autonomy. Continued evaluation is necessary before stronger
claims are justified.
