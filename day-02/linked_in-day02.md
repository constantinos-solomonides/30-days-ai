AI Day 02 — On Writing Good Documentation

Most developers complain when documentation is missing or bad.
Yet most developers don’t write documentation themselves.

Or they write it at the end.
From memory.
Under time pressure.
When context is already gone.
That’s how documentation turns into fiction.

In Day 02 of The Pareto Line, I explain why documentation as an insurance policy.
You don’t hope to need it.
But when you do, you’re glad it’s there.

Some failures are systemic:

- Documentation isn't treated as a deliverable
- Agile gets used as an excuse

Others are individual choices:
- Waiting for "later" that never comes
- Not having a system in place
- Assuming memory will be reliable enough

AI can help with cleanup and restructuring.
It doesn't replace documentation. It evolves it.
It doesn't understand your system for you.

Like an enthusiastic junior, it still needs supervision to perform optimally
