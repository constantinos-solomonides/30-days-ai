    theme: On writing good documentation

  disclosure:
    mandatory: true
    placement: after_tldr
    wording: canonical_frozen

  intent:
    primary:
      - Discuss the value and types of good documentation
      - Explain how consistency and templating has helped
      - Discuss what change of perspective has helped me write better documents
    secondary:
      - Demonstrate disciplined AI usage without hype

  content:
    problem_context:
      - Documentation is something developers consider boring and do it badly
    perspective:
      - Lack of documentation creates roadblocks in testing and release
      - Writing documentation after the fact results in entrenching misconceptions
      - Documentation fails for principally these reasons
        - Agile and SCRUM are misunderstood to not require documentation (systemic issue)
        - People treat it as a not-my-problem thing (systemic issue)
        - It's rarely a deliverable now (systemic issue)
        - It's treated as an all-or-nothing sometimes

  framework:
    name: Documentation isn't for now, it's for when you need it
    metaphor:  The laundry storage approaches. Big pile or neatly folded?
    components:
      - name: "Axis: Types of documentation"
        includes: 
            - Developer
            - User
            - Tester
            - Designer
        excludes: []
        cost_of_ignoring:
            - Issues with communication
            - Later is sometimes never
            - Disjoint understanding or implementation
      - name: "Axis: For whom it is"
        includes: 
            - Self now
            - Self in the future
            - Others that are technical
            - End users
        excludes: []
        cost_of_ignoring: 
            - It becomes harder to write documentation "later" because you forgot
            - Future self notes require work from current self
      - name: Depth and style of documentation
        includes: 
            - Disjoint notes in a big file
            - Recording of sessions
            - Follow one of many documentation standards (META:{give links of documentation styles as example})
            - Start with 0 assumptions, put in every detail and assumption

  Real-world example:
    scenario:
      description: Returning to a challenging project
      background: 
        - I was assigned testing for the work of a team that wouldn't provide documentation
        - The team was practicing the "I'll just show you how it works" approach
        - There was a circular logical fallacy in their approach 
        - Fallacy stage one, they wouldn't provide their lab step-by-step, saying we should mimic customer setup
        - Fallacy stage two, they wouldn't provide generic instructions, they would simply demo their setup
      problems_that_arose:
        - Turns out they didn't explain key limitations of their product
        - There were a lot of unstated assumptions, that collapsed when moving to an independent setup
      what i did:
        - Painstakingly documented every information I got in a small personal file
        - Created a shared document in team's formal documentation tool
        - Started from zero and recorded those steps and assumptions in the formal documentation
      how it helped:
        - When reassigned testing six months down the line I didn't remember anything
        - The documentation allowed me to go an 80% of the way avoiding interactions with a problematic  team
        - Others could take up testing without need for extensive handouts and watching videos
  my approach:
    scenario: 
      description: How I approach documentation
      background: 
        - The first time I was laid-off I realized that I left others one big pile
        - The company ended-up changing my layoff to an internal move, so I had to interact with the colleagues still (META:{describe feeling slight shame, couldn't take pride in my work})
      resolution:
        - Treat every day of work as potentially last
        - Follow a "small pile of laundry, then put in place" approach to documentation
        - I keep the immediate work tracked in a simple file that is not well organized
        - I then do a bottom-up rewrite where I record steps from clean state and record my assumptions clearly
    benefits:
        - Repetition makes one better at it
        - near-zero handover effort
  closing thoughts:
    - AI changes things in terms of doing the cleanup and structuring
    - The "enthusiastic junior" approach must still be taken with AI
    - We should also introduce another type of documentation, AI guidance
    - Documentation isn't wasted time, it's reflection time
    - Trying to explain something can reveal issues
