    ### Series Disclosure

    *This article is part of a 30-day experimental series where I deliberately use the paid version of OpenAI to write articles and generate shortened LinkedIn posts. I use a Pareto approach: getting roughly 80% of the draft is acceptable, and I then edit and correct the result (see the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)).*

    *I’m AI-skeptical in the sense that I consider AI a useful tool, but not what industry hype often claims it to be. I treat it like an enthusiastic junior: it can produce solid results when properly guided and reviewed, but it can create serious problems if allowed to operate without supervision.*

    *Alongside writing, I’m also using a mix of local and online AI models to rebuild scaled-down versions of older projects I previously worked on in enterprise settings. I’m choosing older projects on purpose: they give me a baseline that makes it easier to assess what AI actually changes in the development workflow and in the final outcomes.*
