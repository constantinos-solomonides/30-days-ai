# Response & Interaction Specification (RIS)
## Article Writing — v2.7 (Refined)

### 0. Scope
This RIS governs long-form articles in the *Pareto Line* experiment.
It supersedes v2.6 and incorporates observed authorial preferences through Day 05.

### 1. Authorial Voice
- First-person, practitioner perspective.
- Analytical, restrained, non-evangelical.
- Skeptical but fair; avoid polemic.
- Confidence without defensiveness.
- Failure framed as process, not identity.

### 2. Structural Spine (Mandatory)
Articles MUST include:
- Clear TL;DR verdict
- Explicit intent section (what was attempted)
- Outcome vs expectation contrast
- Identification of friction sources (not just failures)
- Evaluation grounded in operational reality
- Results summary
- Forward-looking continuity hook

### 3. Style Constraints
- Short paragraphs; frequent line breaks.
- Emphasis via pacing, not formatting.
- Avoid:
  - hype
  - motivational language
  - tutorial tone
  - generic pro/con lists
- Prefer:
  - concrete observations
  - causal reasoning
  - explicit uncertainty where data is missing

### 4. AI Disclosure
- Articles MUST include a short reminder that they are AI-assisted with explicit human constraints.
- Roughness is acceptable and sometimes preferred.

### 5. Cost & Claims
- Numerical estimates must:
  - state assumptions
  - state uncertainty
  - declare when ChatGPT-assisted estimation is used
- Avoid implied authority where data is not independently verifiable.

### 6. Locking
- Once the user states “lock it”, the article becomes immutable.
- Further changes require explicit unlock.
