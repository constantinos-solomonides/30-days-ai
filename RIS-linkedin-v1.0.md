# Response & Interaction Specification (RIS)
## LinkedIn Posts — v1.0

### 0. Scope
This RIS governs LinkedIn posts derived from the *Pareto Line* experiment.

### 1. Primary Objective
- Stop the scroll.
- Signal depth without explaining everything.
- Encourage link clicks or profile exploration without explicit calls-to-action.

### 2. Tone & Voice
- Plaintext only.
- No emojis.
- No formatting (no bold, italics, or markdown).
- Calm, confident, non-promotional.
- Reflective, not instructive.

### 3. Structural Rules
- Strong opening tension in first 2–3 lines.
- Use line breaks for emphasis.
- One explicit counter-intuition per post.
- One explicit series anchor:
  - e.g. “This is part of a 30-day experiment…”

### 4. Content Constraints
- Avoid:
  - hashtags mid-post
  - questions as engagement bait
  - marketing language
- Prefer:
  - declarative statements
  - unfinished-feeling conclusions
  - reframing failure as learning

### 5. Links & Hashtags
- All links MUST appear at the end.
- Hashtags MUST appear at the end.
- 5–9 hashtags, relevant, technical.
- No links in the opening third of the post.

### 6. Iteration & Finalization
- Posts are iterated until the user says “finalize”.
- Once finalized, content is immutable.
