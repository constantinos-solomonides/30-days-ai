  disclaimer:
      - Each "day" in the series tracks a work-day of effort
      - There was no "cheating" despite the delay in posting, delay was due to important offline-world tasks
  intent:
    primary:
      - work on building the sandbox manually
    secondary:
      - compare challenges of working with AI vs working manually
      - See how much the use of ai has become a habit already

  key_points in debugging:
    core differences:
      - human work is more linear than compared to ai
      - experience allows identifying the issue using targeted approach instead of trying things until something works
      - The paradox remains that to build a sandbox so AI can be safely used using AI is a pain
      - **reminder** the build-from-scratch is intentional, otherwise percentage of human vs AI effort would be masked

    additional_challenges:
      - AI tools also generate documentation with AI
      - Chatbot helpers are useful
      - The automatically-built structure is sub-par
      - The documentation does not take human limitations sufficiently into account

    approach:
     - Go from end-to-start, verify communication works
     - Compare times between any two points
     - Increase verbosity to identify issue
     - Use simple request "say hi to me"

    outcomes:
      - connectivity worked OK
      - cURL gets a response adequately fast for simple requests
      - OpenHands introduces **a lot** of useless context (RIS) when making the request, this causes the delay

    conclusions:
      - Openhands introducing unsolicited content is a good example of ai bloat
      - Iteration with paid-for AI agents would have been way more expensive without visibility
      - Blind trust in tools remains a bad idea

    next_steps_and_outcomes:
      - Introduced a simple Ubuntu container that can be rebuilt as needed
      - First search led to use of 'openclaw' -> Not the right choice, better for chat etc
      - openclaw documentation suffers from the 'not optimized for humans' mentioned above
      - started work on integrating opencode instead
    wrap_up:
      - Still no local ai agent created
      - **important** this is fun and a learning experience
      - **important** this resembles past experience that gave me useful knowledge applied to work
      - This is not a failure, as it allows the experiment to advance
      - more details tomorrow with summary
      - The fact that real-world can take away from progress is an argument for using agents. No idle time when busy
