AI Day 06 - A day of manual work

Day 06 was the day I worked without using AI

Because playing the role of agent manually was draining;
and because I wanted to compare how work goes on when done manually

This experiment is about actively using AI every day. But trying to have AI
build me a working sandbox takes too much time. So, as I am forced to downgrade my
expectations repeatedly, I decided to have a day of manual work.

What changed?

Doing things took more time. But the progress was linear.

Without suggestions branching in different directions, I debugged the
way I normally would:

Reduce the request to something trivial. Start at the last node in the
chain. Increase verbosity. Measure response time. Move step by step.

Turns out that Ollama was fast enough. LiteLLM was fast enough. Openhands added bloat.

A simple request was sent with too many extra instructions and constraints.
The model wasn't struggling - it was processing unnecessary material.

That was the main takeaway.

AI doesn't just help. It can also quietly expand scope - and cost - if
you don't monitor what gets sent.

I also noticed something else.

A lot of tooling documentation today is AI-generated. It looks
structured and complete, but it isn't always optimized for how engineers
actually read under time pressure. Older documentation often had a
"rubber duck" quality - the author clarified things while explaining
them. That effect is harder to see now.

Day 06 did not result in a working sandbox.

It did result in:

• A validated communication pipeline
• A cleaner container baseline
• Removal of an approach that was adding complexity
• A clearer understanding of where friction was introduced

Manual debugging is linear. AI-assisted debugging is iterative.

Both have trade-offs. Both have benefits.

Day 07 will focus on a retrospective - where AI actually saved time, and where it didn't.

As with the rest of the series, each "day" represents a real workday of
effort. Posting may be delayed due to normal obligations, but the work
itself follows the actual timeline.
