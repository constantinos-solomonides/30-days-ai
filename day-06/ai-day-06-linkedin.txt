On Day 06, I turned AI off.

Not because it failed. Not because I was frustrated. But because I
wanted a clean comparison.

This experiment is happening while I’m actively using AI every day. So
the only way to compare manual vs AI-assisted work fairly is to remove
AI in the middle of that usage — not after stepping away for a while.

What changed?

The work felt slower. But it felt simpler.

Without suggestions branching in different directions, I debugged the
way I normally would:

Reduce the request to something trivial. Start at the last node in the
chain. Increase verbosity. Measure response time. Move step by step.

cURL was fast. Ollama was fast. LiteLLM was fast.

The slowdown came from injected context further up the stack. A simple
request accumulated extra instructions and constraints along the way.
The model wasn’t struggling — it was processing unnecessary material.

That was the main takeaway.

AI doesn’t just help. It can also quietly expand scope — and cost — if
you don’t monitor what gets sent.

I also noticed something else.

A lot of tooling documentation today is AI-generated. It looks
structured and complete, but it isn’t always optimized for how engineers
actually read under time pressure. Older documentation often had a
“rubber duck” quality — the author clarified things while explaining
them. That effect is harder to see now.

Day 06 did not result in a working sandbox.

It did result in:

• A validated communication pipeline • A cleaner container baseline •
Removal of an approach that was adding complexity • A clearer
understanding of where friction was introduced

Manual debugging is linear. AI-assisted debugging is iterative.

Both have trade-offs.

Day 07 will focus on measurement — where AI actually saved time, and
where it didn’t.

As with the rest of the series, each “day” represents a real workday of
effort. Posting may be delayed due to normal obligations, but the work
itself follows the actual timeline.
