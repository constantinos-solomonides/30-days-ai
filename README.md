# 30 Days of AI — A Skeptical, Inspectable Experiment

This repository tracks a **30-day experiment** in using AI as a *tool*, not as an authority.

The goal is not to showcase what AI *can* do in isolation, but to document **how it behaves inside a disciplined workflow**, where ideas, decisions, and accountability remain human-owned.

The experiment deliberately treats AI like an **enthusiastic junior**: fast, helpful, and unreliable enough to require supervision.

## What This Repository Is (and Isn’t)

### It **is**:
- A record of **explicit AI-assisted writing and development**
- A portfolio built **with AI and personal expertise**, transparently
- A comparison between **known baselines** and AI-assisted workflows
- A place where drafts, prompts, edits, and reasoning are inspectable

### It **is not**:
- An AI demo repository
- A productivity or hype showcase
- A claim that AI replaces expertise or judgment
- A collection of “AI-written” content without accountability

---

## Core Principles

### 1. AI Is Used Deliberately, Not Maximally
AI is used following the **Pareto principle**:  
getting roughly **80% of the way there is acceptable**, and the remaining work is done by editing, correcting, and validating.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle

### 2. Ideas Remain Human-Owned
AI may help with:
- Drafting
- Scaffolding
- Recall
- Exploration

AI does **not**:
- Decide what matters
- Define correctness
- Replace judgment

### 3. Skepticism Is Structural
This project is explicitly **AI-skeptical** — not in opposition to the tool, but to the way it is often marketed and over-trusted.

Skepticism is enforced through:
- Repeated disclosure in every article
- Explicit constraints in YAML
- CI checks that prevent omission or drift

## Repository Structure

The repository is intentionally structured so that **process is visible**, not just results.
